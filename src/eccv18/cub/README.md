In order to run from training GAN to Classification, you must:

1. Navigate to project frwgan-eccv18 [https://github.com/rfelixmg/frwgan-eccv18.git]
	1.1 Please, make sure this is the last commit;

2. Add project util [https://github.com/rfelixmg/util.git]

3. Regarding the training process for RWGAN. In the file, ./src/eccv18/cub/train_gan:
	3.1. Change dataroot to your database;
	3.2. Change base directory to desired folder;
	3.3. Change GPUs to be used;
	3.3. run: bash ./src/eccv18/cub/train_gan

4. Regarding augmenting the dataset with pseudo features. In the file, ./src/eccv18/cub/augment_dataset:
	4.1. add the _GAN_REF_, which is the folder generated by previous bash file in the base folder;

5. Regarding training the new classifier. In the file, ./src/eccv18/cub/train_benchmark:
	5.1. add the _GAN_REF_;

6. Regarding testing the current model,  In the file, ./src/eccv18/cub/test_benchmark:
	6.1. add the references to the weights of the model, and an output folder;
